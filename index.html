            THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT

            <p>
            Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs, broken
            CSS support, and abandoned browsers.
            </p>

            <p>
            We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of
            folk like the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr title="Web Standards Project">WASP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.

            The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see
            with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the
            web.

            SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?
            </div>
            <p>
            There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage
            participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the
            style sheet into this very page. The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.
            </p>

            <p>
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be
            illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are
            placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have
            contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

                Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills are
                necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices can use them as
                starting points. Please see the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.

                You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This may seem daunting at first if
                you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as
                a guide.

                <p>
                Download the sample <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and
                please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file to a web server under your control. Send us a
                link to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it

            REQUIREMENTS
            </p>

            <p>
            Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2">CSS 1 &amp; 2</abbr> usage. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3 &amp; 4</abbr> should be limited to
            widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about
            functional, practical <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public.
            The only real requirement we have is that your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.Luckily, designing this way shows how well
            various browsers have implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly
            consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these
            days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every
            platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the
            latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).We ask that you submit
            original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try
            to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We’re well past the point of needing
            another garden-related design.This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full
            copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see submission guidelines), but we ask you release
            your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a Creative Commons license identical to the one on this site so that others may learn from
            your work.
